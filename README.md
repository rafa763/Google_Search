## Background

When performing a Google search, the query works by encoding form data in the URL as a query string. Google's search results page receives the query parameters and displays the relevant results. This project replicates this functionality using HTML and CSS.

## Specification

- The website should have three pages: Google Search (index.html), Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
- Links in the upper-right of each page should allow navigation to other pages (e.g., from Google Search to Image Search or Advanced Search, and vice versa).
- The Google Search page should include a search bar with rounded corners and a centered search button.
- The Google Image Search page should have a similar design as the Google Search page but with a search button to perform image searches.
- The Google Advanced Search page should have four input fields for specific search queries.
- The "Advanced Search" button should be blue with white text and lead to search results for the given query.
- An "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query.

## Features

- Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes.
- Input fields and buttons styled to resemble Google's aesthetics.
- Easy navigation between Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search pages.
